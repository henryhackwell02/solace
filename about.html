                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Solace was born from a simple belief: that in a world often overwhelmed by challenging news,
                    there's immense value in creating a space dedicated to stories that uplift, inspire, and
                    remind us of our shared humanity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started in 2024 as a small project among friends who wanted to counterbalance the
                    negativity that often dominates our feeds. What began as a shared document of uplifting
                    stories quickly grew into something bigger - a community of people seeking and sharing
                    moments of hope.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We curate and share stories of kindness, resilience, breakthrough, and everyday moments of
                    beauty. Our mission is not to ignore life's difficulties, but to ensure that tales of hope
                    and human goodness find their way to those who need them most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that what we focus on shapes our worldview. By highlighting the good that happens
                    every day - from small acts of kindness to remarkable achievements - we hope to provide
                    balance and perspective.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Authenticity:</strong> Every story we share is real. We don't embellish or
                    manufacture positivity - genuine human experiences are powerful enough on their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Solace is free and always will be. Hope shouldn't have a price tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Community:</strong> We believe everyone has a story worth sharing. Our readers are
                    also our contributors, creating a cycle of positivity that grows stronger together.
                </p>
